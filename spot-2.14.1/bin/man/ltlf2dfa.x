[NAME]
ltlf2dfa \- translate LTLf formulas into DFA

[NOTE ON OUTPUT FORMATS]
Spot currently has little support for finite automata, and does
not really support any DFA output format at the moment.  When
the \fB\-\-dot\fR or \fB\-\-hoaf\fR opetions are used, the DFA is
converted into a BÃ¼chi automaton before being displayed.

[BIBLIOGRAPHY]
The following paper describes how direct translation from LTLf to MTDFA works.
